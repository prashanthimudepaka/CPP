1)
You are given a sorted array arr of distinct values and a target value x. 
You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.

If the value is present in the array, then return its index. Otherwise, 
determine the index where it would be inserted in the array while maintaining the sorted order.

2)You're given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x.
 Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.
4,7,8,10


3) Given a sorted array of N integers, write a program to find the index 
of the last occurrence of the target key. If the target is not found then return -1.

4)You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X, 
you have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.
