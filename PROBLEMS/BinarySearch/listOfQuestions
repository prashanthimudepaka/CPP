1)
You are given a sorted array arr of distinct values and a target value x. 
You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.

If the value is present in the array, then return its index. Otherwise, 
determine the index where it would be inserted in the array while maintaining the sorted order.

2)You're given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x.
 Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.
4,7,8,10


3) Given a sorted array of N integers, write a program to find the index 
of the last occurrence of the target key. If the target is not found then return -1.

4)You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X, 
you have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.
ex:
inp: 0 0 1 2 3 4 
x=0 
0 1
5) Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in
 ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at 
some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

inp: 10 20 30 40 0 3 5 7 9
     0  1   2  3  4  5  6 7
     10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
     0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
6) Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
 Now the array is rotated between 
1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array.
